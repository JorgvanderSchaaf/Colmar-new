Colmar project

html and css for desktop and mobile.

May have used more divs than needed. Took some out during refactoring. 
Did apply single classes for grouped styling.
Finding it difficult to get divs, images and content covering full width of screen. 

20170531 21:00 hours (GMT+1): I just noticed that my mobile styling doesn't come through in the master branch. Going to check what is going on and correct this.
